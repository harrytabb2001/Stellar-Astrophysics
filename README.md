Fourth lab experiment from my first year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done in excel so no .py files are included. Note that no report was written for this experiment.

* Stellar Astrophysics Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Stellar Astrophysics Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
