# Stellar Astrophysics
## Summary
Fourth lab experiment from my first year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done in Excel so no .py files are included. Note that no report was written for this experiment.

The aim of this experiment was to find a relationship between gas density and star formation rate in galaxy M100 by analysing intensities from the galaxy in the UV range and the IR range.

## Technical Highlights
* Data Analysis in Excel
* Linear Regression in Excel
* Chi-Square Analysis

## Files
* Stellar Astrophysics Lab Script.pdf contains a brief outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Stellar Astrophysics Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
